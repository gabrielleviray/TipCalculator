## Notes

7/16/2020
So far, I created this basic calculator that calculates total billing based on three different tip percentages. 
I just started learning Swift and working with Xcode so I took some extra time learning where certain tools are and what they do.
In the future, I will refine this application and add UI styles to make the application more appealing for the user and add more helpful functionalities.
